# snake_and_ladder
This Python program simulates the classic Snakes and Ladders game in a command-line interface. Players can climb ladders, avoid snakes, and race to square 100. Supporting 2 to 4 players, each takes turns rolling the dice and moving their pawn while encountering snakes or ladders along the way!
